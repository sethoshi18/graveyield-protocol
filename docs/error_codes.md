This file is the authoritative table of on-chain error codes returned by
the two GraveYield programs. Auditors, indexer authors, SDK consumers,
and front-end error handlers should map codes against this file. The
`published/` `.docx` snapshots are intentionally frozen between minor
revisions and may lag behind; this markdown wins per the contract in
[`README.md`](README.md).

## Sync convention

Any change to either program's `errors.rs` **MUST** land alongside an
update to this file in the same PR. Spec drift on this surface is
treated as a bug.

Anchor's `#[error_code]` macro automatically offsets each enum variant's
Rust discriminant by 6000. The **Code** column below is the on-chain
emitted value (= Rust discriminant + 6000). Do not confuse the two.

## GraveScanner — 6000-6019

Source: [`../programs/grave-scanner/src/errors.rs`](../programs/grave-scanner/src/errors.rs).
Discriminants 12-14 (codes 6012-6014) are intentionally reserved for
future v4.x additions to the pre-anchor error space.

| Code | Name | Condition |
|------|------|-----------|
| 6000 | `Unauthorized` | Caller lacks the multisig authority required. |
| 6001 | `PoolNotEligible` | Pool does not satisfy all six derelict-pool criteria. |
| 6002 | `LaunchPriceNotFound` | `LaunchPrice` PDA missing for this pool. |
| 6003 | `UnsupportedAmm` | AMM program mismatch or unsupported pool layout. |
| 6004 | `MathOverflow` | Arithmetic overflow during eligibility computation. |
| 6005 | `InvalidClock` | Clock sysvar unavailable or returned invalid data. |
| 6006 | `InvariantViolation` | `ProtocolConfig` update violates a locked invariant. |
| 6007 | `AmmAdapterUnimplemented` | AMM adapter registered but parser is a pre-mainnet stub. Live list in [`PRE_MAINNET_CHECKLIST.md`](PRE_MAINNET_CHECKLIST.md). |
| 6008 | `LockerAdapterUnimplemented` | Locker adapter registered but not implemented. Retired as a live call site by the Phase 1.1 UNCX Raydium V4 adapter (LOCKER-001); retained as a stable code-space slot. |
| 6009 | `PoolDataParseError` | Pool account data did not match the expected layout. |
| 6010 | `ProtocolPaused` | GraveScanner is paused; `evaluate_pool_*` reverts. No effect on rent reclaim or the GraveVault claim path. |
| 6011 | `CriteriaBitmapMismatch` | Phase 2 produced a bitmap that disagrees with the originating `EligibilityAnchor`. |
| 6015 | `AnchorNotFound` | Phase 2 attempted without an `EligibilityAnchor` PDA. |
| 6016 | `EpochConfirmationPending` | Phase 2 attempted before `anchor.first_eligible_epoch + MIN_EPOCH_CONFIRMATION`. |
| 6017 | `AnchorInvalidated` | `EligibilityAnchor` was invalidated by multisig. Phase 2 certification attempts and repeat `invalidate_anchor` calls on an already-invalidated anchor revert with this code. |
| 6018 | `AnchorNotStale` | `sweep_stale_anchor` called before the staleness window elapsed. |
| 6019 | `CertTtlBelowMinimum` | `update_protocol_config` rejected a `cert_ttl_seconds` value below `MIN_CERT_TTL_SECONDS` (600s = 10 min). |
| 6020 | `LockerMarkerAccountRequired` | The UNCX per-pool lock marker PDA (`["global_lp_tracker", amm_id]`) was not supplied in `remaining_accounts`; Criterion 5 cannot be evaluated soundly without it. See [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) §5. |
| 6021 | `LockerLockEvidenceRequired` | The UNCX marker exists on chain (pool was locked at least once) but no TokenLock evidence was supplied; completeness of evidence is mandatory in this state. |
| 6022 | `InvalidLockerAccount` | A supplied locker-program account failed validation: ownership, discriminator, size, or PDA re-derivation from its own `lock_global_id`. |
| 6023 | `LockerAccountMismatch` | A supplied TokenLock is bound to a different `(amm_id, lp_mint)` pair than the pool under evaluation. |
| 6024 | `AttestationMissing` | No `ed25519_program` verify instruction immediately precedes the scanner instruction (or the sysvar read failed) — no oracle signature was evaluated in this transaction. See [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) §5 / D8. |
| 6025 | `InvalidAttestationOffsets` | The precompile's `Ed25519SignatureOffsets` are malformed or do not bind the signature to exactly the 112-byte attestation embedded in the instruction data (wrong signature count, out-of-bounds offsets, wrong instruction index, non-canonical message offset). |
| 6026 | `AttestationOracleMismatch` | The public key covered by the runtime-verified signature is not the configured `ProtocolConfig.activity_oracle`. |
| 6027 | `AttestationBindingMismatch` | The attestation message binds different values than the instruction params echo: the `(amm_program_id, pool_address)` pair (C1), or the `(base_mint, quote_mint)` pair / launch price (C2, D9). |
| 6028 | `AttestationTimestampInvalid` | The attested last-swap timestamp is the zero sentinel or lies in the future relative to the current `Clock`. |
| 6029 | `AttestationStale` | The attestation's `issued_slot` no longer resolves in the `SlotHashes` sysvar — replay outside the ~512-slot freshness window. |
| 6030 | `AttestationSlotHashMismatch` | The attested slot hash does not match the chain's `SlotHashes` entry for `issued_slot`. |
| 6031 | `AttestationSlotInvalid` | The attestation's `issued_slot` is zero or in the future relative to the current slot. |
| 6032 | `InvalidLaunchPrice` | The attested launch price is zero — a price-collapse baseline must be strictly positive. See [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) §5 / D9. |
| 6033 | `LaunchPriceMintMismatch` | The recorded launch-price baseline belongs to a different token pair than the live pool under evaluation — the recorded `(base_mint, quote_mint)` must equal the pool's parsed mints before C2 can consume the price. |
| 6034 | `CertStillValid` | Phase 2 was re-run while the pool's `EligibilityCert` is still live (before `expires_at`). A live cert cannot be overwritten — wait for the TTL to elapse, then re-run Phase 2 to reissue in place (spec D10). This gate makes two live certs for one pool structurally impossible. |

## GraveVault — 7000-7019

Source: [`../programs/grave-vault/src/errors.rs`](../programs/grave-vault/src/errors.rs).
Codes 7015-7019 added by m5 (salvage_pool execution path). Future m6/m7
additions append at 7020+ and must land in lock-step with the Rust
source per the sync convention.

| Code | Name | Condition |
|------|------|-----------|
| 7000 | `Unauthorized` | Caller lacks the multisig authority required for this instruction. |
| 7001 | `InvalidEligibilityCert` | `EligibilityCert` PDA missing, expired, or owned by the wrong program. |
| 7002 | `EligibilityCertExpired` | `EligibilityCert` TTL has passed. Re-run Phase 2 to mint a fresh cert. |
| 7003 | `ProtocolPaused` | Protocol is paused — only `claim_lp_proceeds` is callable. |
| 7004 | `InvalidShareSplit` | Distribution shares (LP / salvor / protocol) did not sum to 10_000 bps. |
| 7005 | `ProtocolShareExceedsCeiling` | Attempted to raise `protocol_share_bps` above the Charter ceiling. |
| 7006 | `LpHolderPoolUnsweepable` | Attempted to sweep, close, or otherwise drain `lp_holder_pool_vault`. This account is unsweepable by any admin key, ever — Charter invariant. *Reserved tripwire: no instruction path attempts a sweep in v1.0, so this error is never raised today.* |
| 7007 | `SlippageExceeded` | Slippage on the Jupiter swap leg exceeded the configured maximum. |
| 7008 | `PriorityFeeExceedsCeiling` | Transaction priority fee exceeds the Charter ceiling. *Reserved: priority fees are SDK/operator-enforced (a callee program cannot observe the compute-unit price); never raised in v1.0 — see [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) D3.* |
| 7009 | `MathOverflow` | Arithmetic overflow during distribution math. |
| 7010 | `InvalidClaimProof` | LP holder is not in the snapshot Merkle tree, or proof is invalid. |
| 7011 | `ClaimAlreadyProcessed` | Claim has already been processed for this `(pool, lp_holder)` pair. |
| 7012 | `BelowDustThreshold` | Quote output below the Jupiter dust threshold; salvage skipped or aborted. *Reserved: the v1.0 dust path skips the swap with a log and continues; it never reverts — see [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) D6.* |
| 7013 | `PreflightFailed` | Pre-flight check against the on-chain pool failed. |
| 7014 | `TimelockNotElapsed` | Timelock window has not yet elapsed for a queued parameter change. *Reserved: the v1.0 timelock is multisig-enforced (Squads scheduling); never raised on-chain — see [`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) D2.* |
| 7015 | `AmmRedemptionFailed` | AMM `remove_liquidity` CPI returned an error or zero output. |
| 7016 | `JupiterSwapFailed` | Jupiter v6 swap CPI returned an error or zero output. |
| 7017 | `AmmCpiUnimplemented` | AMM CPI adapter is a pre-mainnet stub (CLMM / Orca Whirlpool / PumpSwap). Pool owner is not the Raydium V4 program. See [`PRE_MAINNET_CHECKLIST.md`](PRE_MAINNET_CHECKLIST.md). |
| 7018 | `InvalidSnapshotData` | Salvor's `lp_total_supply_at_snapshot` does not match the on-chain LP mint supply at salvage time. |
| 7019 | `UnsupportedBaseToken` | Pool base token is not WSOL. Raised by `salvage_pool` when the pool's on-chain AmmInfo mints (coin@400 / pc@432) show neither — or both — sides as WSOL, BEFORE any CPI. Exactly one WSOL side is required in v1.0; both orientations (coin=WSOL, pc=WSOL) are supported and fork-proven (Phase 3, CPI-010 retired). USDC/USDT-style settlement (no WSOL side) remains a v1.1 deliverable. |
| 7020 | `DustNothingToSweep` | `sweep_dust` found no retained memecoin: the vault memecoin ATA is empty (the conversion leg fully drained it) or the pool was fully converted. Phase 4, D6. |
| 7021 | `DustAlreadySwept` | `sweep_dust` already ran for this pool: the receipt stamps `dust_swept_at_ts` and a second sweep would double-credit the treasury. One-shot by design (Phase 4, D6). |

## Drift from the v3.0 .docx snapshot

The Combined Tech Doc v3.0 `.docx` snapshot referenced in
[`README.md`](README.md) §"Canonical spec set" lists a different
GraveVault error scheme in its §4.2 — 7000-7018 with names including
`AMMRedemptionFailed`, `JupiterSwapFailed`, `InvalidMerkleProof`,
`InvalidSnapshotData`, and `ComputeBudgetTooLow`. That scheme was
authored before the on-main numbering was locked and has since drifted.

Per [`README.md`](README.md), when a markdown source-of-truth and a
`.docx` snapshot disagree, the markdown wins. This file is the markdown
source-of-truth for the error tables, so the v3.0 `.docx` scheme is
**superseded** and will be re-rendered at the next minor revision.

The full Combined Tech Doc markdown
(`grave-scanner-grave-vault-combined.md`) is now committed to the repo;
its §7 references this file rather than re-tabulating the codes, as this
contract requires.
